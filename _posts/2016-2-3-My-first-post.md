## And my first Blog, to be correct.

For a long time i was looking for an elegant tool to maintain a website, focused on content and letting me tweak the design just enough to make it mine, but not as much as to spend my time maintaining building a template.

It seems that Jekyll is the right tool for this and, coupled with GitHub pages, provides the ease of use that i was looking For.

>I love things that are simple on the surface and complexly-elegant on the inside.
