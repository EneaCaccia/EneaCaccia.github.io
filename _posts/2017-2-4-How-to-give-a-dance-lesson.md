title: How to give a dance lesson
---

- Don't fuck up while counting 5, 6, 7, 8!
- prepare for the "random" parts like warmup **much** more than the structured parts. It's the beginning of the lesson and you have to get in sync too, don't leave the part where you build energy to chance.
- Choose cool songs
- Don't explain too much
- Be predictable. The students have to be able to know what the next step is without really listening to you.
- Repeat yourself twice. _always_.
- Prepoare so that if they are quick learners you have some spare moves. If they are slow learners, you have to be able to give them something without finishing your planned routine.
- find a way to get quick feedback as you go along. 

>"Got it? Say Yeah!"-"Yeah!"
